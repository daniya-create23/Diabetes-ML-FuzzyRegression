# **Diabetes-ML-FuzzyRegression** 🩺📊  

## **Overview**  
This project implements a **fuzzy logic-based regression model** for diabetes prediction. The system applies **fuzzy inference rules** to classify and predict diabetes-related outcomes based on features like **age, BMI, blood pressure, and sex**. Additionally, a **Random Forest Regressor** is trained on the fuzzy outputs to enhance prediction accuracy.  

✅ **Developed using Jupyter Notebook**  
✅ **Integrates Machine Learning for Improved Predictions**

## **Features**  
- 🤖 **Fuzzy Logic Inference System** – Uses fuzzy membership functions to analyze input data.  
- 🔢 **Regression Model** – Implements **Random Forest Regression** for enhanced numerical predictions.  
- 🧩 **Fuzzy Rules-Based Approach** – Generates predictions based on expert-defined rules.  
- 📊 **Visualization of Membership Functions** – Graphical representation of fuzzy sets.  

---

## **Dataset & Input Variables**  
The model is trained on a **diabetes dataset** containing the following features:  
- **AGE** – Patient’s age  
- **SEX** – Male (1) / Female (2)  
- **BMI** – Body Mass Index  
- **BP** – Blood Pressure  
- **Y (Output)** – Target outcome (Diabetes-related metric)  

---

## **Fuzzy Logic System**  
The fuzzy model defines membership functions for each feature:  

### **AGE**  
- 🟦 **Young** (0 - 40)  
- 🟩 **Middle-aged** (20 - 60)  
- 🟥 **Old** (50 - 100)  

### **BMI**  
- 🟦 **Low** (10 - 20)  
- 🟩 **Medium** (15 - 25)  
- 🟥 **High** (20 - 40)  

### **BP (Blood Pressure)**  
- 🟦 **Low** (80 - 120)  
- 🟩 **Normal** (110 - 130)  
- 🟥 **High** (120 - 200)  

### **Fuzzy Rules**  
Some example fuzzy rules applied in the system:  
1️⃣ **IF** AGE is **old**, BMI is **high**, and BP is **high**, **THEN** Diabetes Risk is **high**.  
2️⃣ **IF** AGE is **young**, BMI is **low**, and BP is **low**, **THEN** Diabetes Risk is **low**.  
3️⃣ **IF** SEX is **male**, AGE is **middle**, and BMI is **medium**, **THEN** Diabetes Risk is **medium**.  
4️⃣ **IF** AGE is **middle**, BMI is **high**, and BP is **medium**, **THEN** Diabetes Risk is **medium**.  
5️⃣ **IF** SEX is **female**, AGE is **young**, and BMI is **low**, **THEN** Diabetes Risk is **low**.
